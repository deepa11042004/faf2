  },
  {
    q: "How does a Public Address System integrate with the Fire Alarm System?",
    a: "Our PA controllers feature emergency priority override relays connected to the Fire Alarm Control Panel. When a fire alarm triggers, the PA system automatically overrides background music and broadcasts voice evacuation instructions."
  },
  {
    q: "Can we make announcements to specific rooms or zones only?",
    a: "Yes. Using multi-zone controllers and paging microphones, operators can select individual zones (e.g., Floor 1, Cafeteria, Warehouse) or broadcast to the entire building simultaneously."
  },
  {
    q: "What are Network IP Speakers and why are they used?",
    a: "Network IP speakers connect directly to Ethernet LAN switches. They eliminate traditional audio wiring, receive power over Ethernet (PoE), and can be configured and managed remotely via web software."
