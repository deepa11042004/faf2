  },
  {
    q: "What happens to access control doors during a power failure?",
    a: "Our access control installations include 24/7 battery backup power supplies. Fail-safe locks (such as maglocks) automatically unlock upon emergency signals or complete power loss to ensure safe evacuation."
  },
  {
    q: "Can access control systems integrate with payroll and attendance software?",
    a: "Yes. All our biometric fingerprint and facial recognition terminals seamlessly synchronize entry/exit timestamps with HR payroll and time-attendance software platforms."
  },
  {
    q: "Can we manage access permissions for multiple doors remotely?",
    a: "Yes. Our IP-networked access control controllers allow administrators to manage user access rights, view live access logs, and issue temporary visitor passes from a centralized desktop or mobile dashboard."
